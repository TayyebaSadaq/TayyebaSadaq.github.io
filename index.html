            <p>Hi!👋🏼
            <br>
            I'm a computer science student who loves to code and create things. I'm passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a book or playing games. 🎮📚
